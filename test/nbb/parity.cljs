(ns test.nbb.parity
  "JVM-free parity test for the ported emitter (`src/kotoba/script.cljc`).

  Two claims, each against a golden the JVM emitter wrote
  (`scripts/gen-parity-golden.clj`, `test/fixtures/parity/`):

  1. `emit` on nbb produces the SAME BYTES as `emit` on the JVM for every KIR
     fixture the JVM test namespace exports (with the fixture's `.opts.edn`
     as emit options when present);
  2. `java-double-string` reproduces `Double.toString` for every f64 in
     `f64.edn`, given as raw bits so the fixture cannot be mis-read.

  And one claim the JVM tests already make, re-made here because the cljs
  verifier is a different instrument: the emitted module runs under Node and
  answers 42n, and a module carrying an ambient global is REFUSED by the token
  scan. Run from the repo root: `npm run test-nbb` (or `nbb test/nbb/parity.cljs`).
  The last line is `SCANNED <n> failed <k>`; SCANNED 0 is exit 2, not a pass."
